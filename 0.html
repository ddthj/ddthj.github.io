			Well gee, it's about time I did this. Hey, ddthj here, and welcome to my website. For much too long I've relied on group chats with friends to store all the material gained from my random projects. This will be my effort to move that information to a more permanent home.

			In my classic "Let's do it from scratch" ideology (which I do not recommend), I'm writing this website from scratch in raw html/css. This won't be the first time I've done a site like this, but that's a topic for another post. Taking inspiration from xkcd, each project page will be numbered. Going to ddthj.com/x will make it easy to jump around to random pages. For now, all projects will appear on the homepage in a little preview button. A search function may be needed later, but for now I plan to keep it as simple as possible. Feature creep is a real disease, even for little hobby projects.

			Since the question will come up: No, I do not know what "ddthj" means. There have been many great suggestions, but I think I will leave this one open-ended.

			Thanks for coming by!
