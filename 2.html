			<h2 class="date">1/13/2023</h2>
			For a long time I thought it'd be really cool to make a robot / RC tractor that could tunnel under the ground. After a lot of snowfall one day, I realized that it might be feasible to make one tunnel under snow. I started this project on 1/5/2022. As you can tell by the finish date of 1/13/2023, this has been quite the project. Let's go over what happened and how you could do something similar yourself.

			The initial goal was pretty simple: "Tunnel through snow." Some misc requirements included "use minimal hardware" and "using available electronics." When designing something like this I recommend doing a little research first, because you're not the first to need underground tunneling equipment. Sure enough, there's an entire class of mining front-loaders designed for pretty much this exact thing:

				Sounds like I already have it all figured out...
			</div>
			The electronics I had on-hand were a couple servo motors, a couple TT motors, and a NoU2. This fit the front-loader design perfectly. I could use each TT motor to drive one axle, one servo for the bucket, and one for steering. The NoU2 would serve as the brains and allow me to drive everything over bluetooth from my laptop with the AlfredoConnect software.

			This left just one requirement to meet: minimal hardware. I didn't want to put fancy ball bearings in this thing or have to buy bushings to throw this together. What's the fun in doing it the easy way? I pulled every trick I knew to design the bot with only a few screws necessary to hold things together. Most components were attached via 3D printed pins with 3D printed C-clips. This was surprisingly effective for slow-rotating parts like the bucket and arm, but not quite as good for the drive shafts.

				Pins and C-clips holding it all together. The pins have a 1mm grove in the ends, and C-clips were tuned to a tight fit.
			</div>
			The most clever design here is seen in the bottom-middle: a linear actuator made from an N20 gear motor. The N20 motor connects to a printed tube with a captive nut on one end. As the motor rotates the tube, a M3 screw can be drawn in or out. This worked surprisingly well, and I think it was mostly luck.

			So this became version 1. It met the design goals, but had one big flaw. The wheels did not provide enough surface area to stop the bot from sinking into the snow, and once it did they struggled to move it along with the frame bottomed-out. This meant I couldn't tunnel off my limited patio, which was lame. <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/yv_RVcqWEIU">Here's a video of me trying anyway.</a>

			Shortly afterwards the snow melted, and I figured that would be the end of the project. Unfortunately when the next winter came around there was a lot more snow, so the project was back on the table. Bigger wheels? No. Bigger Snowbot.

			</div>
			I redid the CAD completely, scaling up the bot to match its giant new wheels. The bucket was now N20-driven to have more torque (and less snow jams in the mechanism), but the rest of the design was practically the same. Against the original goal I decided to use ball bearings this time, as I didn't want to sink hours into designing a new set of c-clips and pins and printed bushings. The new bot size did mean I would need more snow depth to tunnel successfully, <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/e12fkIXsHH0">but I had plenty of snow.</a>

			Sadly, this version still suffered from the low frame. Just like its real mining counterpart, the loader needs to have solid ground to function. For fun, I did flip the frame upside-down to give it ground clearance, allowing it to offroad at the expense of tunneling. There was another issue with the new leadscrew design that made it susceptible to failure in the cold... which was the operating environment.

			Lessons learned:
			1. If a design works, there is a difference between improving upon it and replacing it. I should have stuck with the old leadscrew design and beefed it up.
			2. Investigate failures better. Had I recognized that my original issue was more related to ground clearance than weight, I would have been able to fix it on the first attempt.
			3. Bluetooth sucks. The range from my laptop was 12' tops. For future RC-car type projects I will use a different solution.

			Anyways, that's all for now. Cya in the next one,
